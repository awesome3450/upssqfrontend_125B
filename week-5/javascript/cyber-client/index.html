        <h1>Server-side VS Client-side code</h1>
    </header>
    <p>When u hear the term server-side and client-side code especially in the content of web development, client-side code is a code that runs on a user's computer<span>-</span>When a web page is viewed, the page client-side code is downloaded then run and displayed by the browser. In this module, we are explicit talking about cient-side javascript.</p>
    <p>Server-side code on the other hand runs on a server, then its result are downloaded and displayed in the browser. Examples of common ones are: PHP, Python, Rubi, C Sharp and even Javascript. Javascript can be used as a server side language for example, the popular node environment.</p>

    <h3>Dynamic VS Static code</h3>
    <p>The word <strong>"Dynamic"</strong> is used to describe both <i>client-side javascript and server-side languages</i>. It refers to the ability to update the display of the web page/app to show different things in different circumstances, generating new concept as required. Server-side code dynamically generate new content on the server e.g pulling data from a database where as client-side javascript dynamically generate new content inside the browser on the client e.g creating a new html table and filling it with data requested from the server, then displaying the table in th web page shown to the user. The meaning is slightly different in two contexts but related & both approaches (server-side and client-side usually work together).</p>
    <hr>
    <p>A web page with no dynamically updating content is referred to as <strong>"Static"</strong><span>-</span>Its just shows the same content all the time.</p>
